# Flappy-Bird-AI
This project consists in an AI that teaches itself to play the game Flappy Bird. To achieve that result, it was used an evolutionary algorithm called [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf), the implementation of this  evolutionary algorithm was made through the python module named [neat](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
